        <div class="my-p-vid">
          <p class="my-p">
            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
            the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will
            experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
            requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill
            and require medical attention. Older people and those with
            underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
            chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop
            serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become
            seriously ill or die at any age. The best way to prevent and slow
            down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how
            the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by
            staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly
            fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub
            frequently. Get vaccinated when it's your turn and follow local
            guidance. The virus can spread from an infected person's mouth or
            nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing
            or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets
            to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory
            etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay
            home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell. <br />
            <br />
            During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were
            commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with
            the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many
            diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the
            Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. In
            January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
            2019-nCoVand 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names
            for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international
            guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people
            in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma. The official
            names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February
            2020. The Director-General, Tedros Adhanom explained that CO stands
            for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for 2019, the year
            in which the outbreak was first identified. The WHO additionally
            uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19"
            in public communications. <br />
            <br />
            The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either
            clades or lineages. The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert
            networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have
            established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2
            genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. The expert group
            convened by the WHO recommended the labeling of variants using
            letters of the Greek Alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and
            Gamma, giving the justification that they "will be easier and more
            practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences." Nextstrain
            divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C),
            while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).
            The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating
            lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.
            <br />
            <br />
            Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.
            Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark. After
            strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was
            assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1
            February 2021.
            <br />
            <br />
            As of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2
            spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7,
            formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the
            Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant),
            the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the
            Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant), and
            the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as
            of 7 December.

      <h3>
        To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the
        following:
      </h3>
      <br />
      <ol class="my-ol">
        <li>Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.</li>
        <li>
          Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don't appear to
          be sick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible
          or when in poorly ventilated settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if
          indoors.
        </li>

      <p class="my-p-symp">
        COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected
        people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover <br />
        without hospitalization.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Most common symptoms:</h3>
      <ol class="my-ol">

        <li>cough</li>
        <li>tiredness</li>
        <li>loss of taste or smell.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Less common symptoms:</h3>
      <ol class="my-ol">
        <li>sore throat</li>
        <li>headache</li>
        <li>aches and pains</li>
        <li>diarrhoea</li>
        <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
        <li>red or irritated eyes.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Serious symptoms:</h3>
      <ol class="my-ol">
        <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
        <li>loss of speech or mobility, or confusion</li>
        <li>chest pain.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p class="my-p-2">
        Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always
        call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
        <br />
        <br />
        People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their
        symptoms at home.
        <br />
        <br />
        On average it takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected with the
        virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.
